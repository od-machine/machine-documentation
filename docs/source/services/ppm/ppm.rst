Architecture

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Medical recommendations data should be indexed onto the neo4j graph.

   .. image:: ppm_graph.png

   * Data for the recommendations was taken from several sources, the majority came from the MOH 2022 recommendation document.

   * In addition to the recommendations, there are links to articles and links that provide further information.

   * Every recommendation is tailored to specific groups of the population based on a number of factors, such as their age (minimum/maximum), gender, biochemical variables, and other factors.

2. Both the questionnaire file and the metadata file should be in the correct place in S3.

   For example for patient number 10000 that uploaded to S3 in 9/7/22 6:46:12 the S3 hierarchy is:

      Questionnaire file: ``PPM/Forms/Patient_Data/P10000/10000_2022-09-07-06-46-12.json``ÃŸ

      Metadata file: ``PPM/Forms/Metadata//P10000/10000_2022-09-07-06-46-12.json``
